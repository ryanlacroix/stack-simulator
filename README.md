Stack Simulator
===============
*COMP2401 Assignment*

  The purpose of this program is to create a simple stack simulation which allows the user to keep track of variables in and out of function calls. This can be particularily useful when trying to determine the cause of misbehaviour of variables between calls and returns. The program is also useful for understanding the control flow of recursive functions.



Compilation:
-----------


  The program can be compiled by running:

  gcc -o stackSim loop.c main.c stack.c stackDefs.h



Launching:

---------
  The program is launched with the command:
  ./stackSim
